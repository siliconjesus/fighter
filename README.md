Fighter game I recreate in langages when I'm bored or learning a new 
programming language

Basics on the game:
- Create two players, player1 and player2
- Each player can do a random amount of damage
- Have each player damage the other player
- If either's Hit Points (HP) is reduced to 0 or below, end the game.

Requires some level of randomness and output.

Different languages will have different difficulties, and limits.  Can only do so much with basic scripting like bash.

Current languages:
- bash
- C++
- python

Future languages:
- C
- Java
- perl
- php
- go (golang)
